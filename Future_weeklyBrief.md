#### Semester Week 6 | Week 1: Future Project Launch

1. Read Speculative Futures (see Slack for the link) Chapter 1. This chapter will situate the project and the following steps. Do not skip it. 

You can also read as an [Ebook through the library](https://getit.library.nyu.edu/go/9463476) (log in)

2. Read [Module 8](http://teaching.polishedsolid.com/ip/mod8/content/index.html#/?_k=6m31cj)
(Yes, I do realize that the Jakob Trollbäck link is broken. This is unfortunate. A new link cannot be found at this point.)

Create each of the following with regard to the final project, and post to your process site under your Future tab:

3. Undergo the Card Sorting exercise as defined in Module 8. Capture clear visual documentation of the exercise and post to your Process site (under the Future/Final tab),  along with a written reflection articulating the 3 outcomes that you generated.

4. Generate at 2 Mind Maps, further exploring 2 of the possible stories. Go deep and let your mind explore these topics. These maps should be dense with off-shoots. What else could be explored here? What is related? Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated and what is developing.


5. Began researching and collecting materials for your Future Project. Identify what subjects/areas you are going to research, to help flesh out this future.
     

#### Semester week 7 | Week 2: Go deeper

1. Take key discoveries that you are gravitating towards from your mind maps, and further explore those explicitly and more deeply through concept maps. Explore the relationships and meanings behind these concepts. This should be larger, explorative and thoughtful.
Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated and how things have developed.
