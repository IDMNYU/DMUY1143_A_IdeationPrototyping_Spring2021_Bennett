### DM-UY 1143 A Ideation and Prototyping
##### Spring 2021 • Katherine Bennett • Tues/Thurs 4:00PM-5:50PM • Remote

#### Semester week 11 & 12 | Week 6-7: Storyboard

**Note that April 19th is a NYU holiday. As such, blogs will not be checked until April 26th**

**Please refer to the announcements and discussion in class regarding the order of importance below. Some of you are ready to begin #5. Some are not there yet (but will hopefully be after week 12)**

1. A developed (i.e. iterated) storyboard. Work towards a high-fidelity storyboard.

Your storyboard is not a summary of your timeline. It builds off of various aspects of your world and forms/weaves a thread of a story. What are the challenges in your world (whether current or resolved)? What are the contraints and problems (whether current or resolved)? What comes in with a saving or destroying force?

Capture the critical segments in a particular window. Think of it as a major scene by major scene of your story (versus moment to moment). Think less about specific details and more about specific points within the story. [An example of major scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRyPSOyC7_c) versus the actual [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyHNuVaZJ-k)

See Module 4 for the different types of storyboards and week 10 for various templates.

2. Define/refine your message back

3. Refine your [timeline](narrative_timeline.md) to high fidelity. Some need to develop their timeline. If you haven't refined your [personas](Personas.md), please do so.

4. Create a physical iteration of your [Future Object/Future Artifact](FutureArtifact.md). Don't forget about the SCAMPER technique to even develop a new (not previously existing) object/artifact. [Miro even has a SCAMPER template.](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lKSlTvc=/)

5. The final presentation that you are creating for your Future Project, must be from that future. Meaning, you can not be in this present and describe that future. You must be an element from that future, or a future further out. This includes media, objects, and people. 

I want to see you use what you have created thus far, for this project, as a launching pad into your Final. I am expecting you to be imaginative, experimental and risky.

In addition to the _method_ you are exploring, create the media used to deliver the information about this world.

*Research. Ideate. Prototype.* Show evidence of each of these three on your site for next week. Mindmaps, storyboards, moodboards, etc. The further you can go, the better. Try to develop a dry-run of it to present in class to get feedback next week.

To prepare your presentation, not only (1) research the technqiues you are using, but (2) refine your content. (3) Connect your message to the presentation. (4) Ensure that your presentation gives us an idea, of what your world is like, and the current standing of the world. Work to connect all of these threads, in a creative, experimental context.




#### Semester week 10 | Week 5: Storyboard

00. To remind you of what you are working towards with this project, I ask you to read [Module 9](https://teaching.polishedsolid.com/ip/mod9/content/index.html#/?_k=ht4wi1) AGAIN. Watch the Ira Glass videos on the power of storytelling. Also in there, you will see an overview of prototyping. Pay attention to that.

0. To define the message back, explore what the issues are in your world. Concept Maps are ideal for this. The message back should be specific (NOT vague nor general i.e. - Love one another, Don't pollute, etc) and link directly to your research and the precise developements of your world and be delivered to our present. Show evidence of your process (research, concept map).


1.  Storyboard (Draft) the narrative which delivers the message back. [Read Module 4](https://teaching.polishedsolid.com/ip/mod4/content/index.html#/?_k=sreswl) for examples of storyboards as well as different types. Use [Mural](https://www.mural.co/templates/storyboarding-1?) to create your storyboard, or perhaps use [one of these other templates](https://github.com/IDMNYU/CreativeCoding_1133-C_Bennett_Fall18/tree/master/storyboardTemplates)


2. Develop your [Future Object/Future Artifact](FutureArtifact.md)s (first drafts/iterations)


3.  Add 3-4 more diverse sources and ANNOTATE them to your annotated bibliograhy. See Module 4 for annotations.


4. Refine [timeline](narrative_timeline.md) + [personas](Personas.md), especially with consideration to the new research, issues, and message back. In the end, they need to be high-fidelity documents situating your world



#### Semester week 9 | Week 4: The plot forms....

_A narrative should be developing, which is set in your world. This narrative will be the tool to help you define an object from your world, as well as the message back to us in the present. These exercises + assignments are preparing your path to the final._

0. Post the product of last weeks in-class exercises (Business/Service in your world & person + identity prompt) as well as this week's (Headlines From the Future).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. What is a Business or Service that is offered in your world? What do they offer or sell? How do they sell it ("cash", account/billing, barter)? How do they offer their services/products (retail store, online, in-home, shipping, etc)? What are their hours of opperation?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Pick a person from your world and their role. This could be anybody, but they have a role (ex. political leader, scientist, teacher, elder, doctor, shop cleric, dissident, marginalized person, engineer). Choose a prompt to write as them in your world (ex, diary entry, shopping list, letter to a friend or political leader, op-ed piece in a publication, describe a holiday, write a meeting agenda).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. What are the headlines in a news publication? Think international, national, regional, cultural, recreational activities, politics, etc. Check out the New York Times or NPR's website to get an idea of the scope. These are HEADLINES not stories!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. What are the emotions of a person in your world? SEE SLACK for the specific fill-in-the-blank prompts and the examples given in class. This is an exercise to help you get more specific about what's going on in the world through the lense of 1 person. This is a two-step prompt process.


00. Develop your Mood boards, as necessary.

000. [Read Module 9](https://teaching.polishedsolid.com/ip/mod9/content/index.html#/?_k=wtxr6j)

1. (If you have not done so already or are not at this point,) Create a concept map (use Mural.co; see Slack resources) which explores the prominent issues in your world. This is the cause + effect; reasons why things are occuring; relationships between people/events; competing passions/forces; alternate markets, etc


2. Add 2-3 more resources to your annotated bibliography, ideally developing aspects from the exercise above. These resources should be diverse (not all concerning the same subject matter)


3. Digging deeper into the issues in your world (or issues now resolved), create a draft of 3-4 [personas](https://github.com/IDMNYU/DMUY1143_A_IdeationPrototyping_Spring2021_Bennett/blob/main/Personas.md) of central people in your world


4. Continue developing and refining your [timeline](narrative_timeline.md) of your world. Ordering significant events in time with relation to one another. You should be working towards a high resolution version for the final.


*Note: In the coming weeks you will be creating:*

  *- an object from your world (several iterations)*

  *- storyboards, developing this narrative (several iterations)*

  *- creative presentation of this project*

*As such, the assignments numbered (above and below) set up the context for you to move forward.*




#### Semester week 8 | Week 3: Develop your world specifically

0. Identify Secondary Topics that are operating in your world. These are not necessarily characteristics of your world (shared values, climate, etc), but other specific ideas that exist in your world. Perhaps these are ideas that resulted from your Card Sorting, or have since begun to form. Use your sketchbook to explore this.

1. Research your Primary and Secondary topics, adding at least 4-5 posts to your annotated bibliography

2. Create a visual mood board which describes your world, how it looks, how it feels, characteristics. These are the visuals of this world. This moodboard should be dense and have multiple images to represent each aspect. One image of a space ship doesn't cut it. there should be multiple images. This should be vast. Start this mood board. If you don't finish it this week, you will the following week. But visual evidence of concerted effort must exist.


3. Create concept maps to further explore various aspects taking place in your world. Concept maps are like mind-maps, yet there is a specific relationship which links one entry from another. Use your sketch book to explore this.


4. Begin a _draft_ of a [timeline](narrative_timeline.md) of your world. Ordering significant events in time with relation to one another. Use your sketchbook to explore this.





#### Semester week 7 | Week 2: Go deeper

0. Revisit the Card Sorting exercise if you are not happy with the results from last time. Remember, each step goes more deeply than the last. Mix and match the cards to generate various ideas.

1. Take key discoveries that you are gravitating towards from your mind maps, and further explore those explicitly and more deeply through concept maps. Explore the relationships and meanings behind these concepts. This should be larger, explorative and thoughtful.

Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated and how things have developed.  


2. Create a post that is a written statement regarding what your Future project is going to be about. Where are you at the end of your card sorting? What sort of specific ideas arose from the interplay and ideation of your themes, descriptors and enabler cards?

3. Develop the world that your future is. What is your future like? (pick at least 6 to incorporate into your world and write a post on your blog detailing this):
    > government <br>
    > living conditions <br>
    > health <br>
    > food <br>
    > economy<br>
    > climate<br>
    > shared values<br>
    > work conditions<br>
    > communication<br>
     > information<br>
    > learning<br>
    > transportation<br>

4. Identify Secondary topics, in addition to your Primary topics for your Future Narrative. These could be other threads/aspects/tenets that are characteristic of your world


5. Research (and be diverse with your research) these topics. What are some analogous times in history? What are some related discoveries in science, technology, medicine, etc? You can pull from these to inform your story. Begin an annotated bibliography, annotating what you have specifically gained from this source. 4 sources minimum. 

#### Semester Week 6 | Week 1: Future Project Launch

1. Read Speculative Futures (see Slack for the link) Chapter 1. This chapter will situate the project and the following steps. Do not skip it. 

You can also read as an [Ebook through the library](https://getit.library.nyu.edu/go/9463476) (log in)

2. Read [Module 8](http://teaching.polishedsolid.com/ip/mod8/content/index.html#/?_k=6m31cj)
(Yes, I do realize that the Jakob Trollbäck link is broken. This is unfortunate. A new link cannot be found at this point.)

Create each of the following with regard to the final project, and post to your process site under your Future tab:

3. Undergo the Card Sorting exercise as defined in Module 8. Capture clear visual documentation of the exercise and post to your Process site (under the Future/Final tab),  along with a written reflection articulating the 3 outcomes that you generated.

4. Generate at 2 Mind Maps, further exploring 2 of the possible stories. Go deep and let your mind explore these topics. These maps should be dense with off-shoots. What else could be explored here? What is related? Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated and what is developing.


5. Began researching and collecting materials for your Future Project. Identify what subjects/areas you are going to research, to help flesh out this future.
