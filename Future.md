## Part 1: World Development
With your group (3-4), you will work to develop a world together. This world will be composed of the following ingredients:

* Government System
* Living Conditions
* Food Availability
* Economic System
* Climate
* Shared Values
* Work Conditions
* Personal Communications
* Information + Learning
* Transportation

As a group, you must generally agree on the aspects of the world. As individuals, you may develop, expand, and deviate from these ingredients with regard to the individual assignments. The depth and richness of your research is what will take you far. Do. not. be. cursory. 

Individually, you will research and develop 4 of these ingredients, providing more detail for each that is based on preceeding histories (whether directly or indirectly). This research will be shared with the group and take the form of a shared Google doc.

This research will form the foundation, upon which other assignments build off of. Hence, you will be using all of that research from your group (and not solely sticking to your own research).

## Part 2:

Individually, you will work to develop this world with greater detail. Based off prompts in class, _individually_ you will create the following assignments:

* Mood Board
* Mind Maps
* Concept Maps
* User Personas
* Future Object (low-fidelity 3-D prototype)
* Future Object (High-fidelity 3-D prototype)
* Flyer/Technical Manual (Low-fi) 
* Flyer/Technical Manual (High-fi) 
* Evidence of Secondary Research
* Storyboard (of/for presentation)
* Creative Presentation regarding world + your object
