# Designing “Seat belts” for Technology 

### 15% of Final Grade

“Every new technology offers an opportunity to ask if it serves our human purposes. From there begins the work of making technology better serve these purposes. It took generations to get nutrition labels on food; it took generations to get speed limits on roads and seat belts and air bags into cars…In the case of communications technology, we have just begun.""

- Turkle, Sherry. Reclaiming conversation: The power of talk in a digital age. Penguin, 2016.

Sherry Turkle has said that users will eventually have to demand “seat belts,” for social media technologies–– safety measures that may require activism before they are implemented, parallel to consumer calls for safety measures from the automotive industry in the 1950’s and 1960’s. The question is, what form will “seat belts” for digital and connected technologies take? Identify a type of technology which you believe needs a seat belt. As you brainstorm, consider technologies within many different areas: transportation, infrastructure, food production, banking, education technologies, etc. Avoid “locking in” to the first technology you think of. 

#### Part 1: Research the history of your chosen technology: when was it invented, by whom and how has it changed over the years? Let your research inform you as to how, in a present or future scenario, your chosen technology may be misused. Do not answer this question before your research (nor let the misuse lead you to whether or not your chosen technology is suitable for this project).

1. Start by doing a mind-map of your chosen technology. Brainstorm what it is, with what ever comes to your mind.

2. Begin your research. 

   * Do a word list, making a list of all the words that come to your mind, covering every aspect that you can think of, regarding your chosen technology.

   * Look up current trends about your technology on the web. What are key things to be mindful of?

   * Create a visual collage of images regarding this technology.

   * Be a fly on the wall, while you watch someone using this technology. What do you notice or observe? Make note of everything!

   * Are there user boards or Reddit boards about your current technology? If so, what is trending on them?

   * Do you know current users of this techology? If so, can you contact them and get them to write either a Love Letter or a Break-up Letter with this technology? Try to get more than one letter!

   * Hit the library and get historical research. How and why did this technology come into being? Was there a predecessor? What are some of the politics surrounding this technology? User issues? Get 3-5 resources.

   * Compiling this information, create a thoughtful interview for users that is thought provoking. Check out [Terry Gross's tips](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/17/style/self-care/terry-gross-conversation-advice.html) on creating a good interview.

   * After reflecting on your research findings thus far, can you create a game or experiment that delves further into your research findings? Make it open ended, allowing you to gain insight.

_Out of the above 9, I expect you to do at least 7 of them. I do understand that not all of these are possible for everyone's technology. Feel free to adopt your own methods that are not specified here._

The goals is that the research should inform you. You should have a much deeper and richer context afterwards. If you do not, come meet with me.

After doing this research, you should have evidence of misuse.



#### Part 2: Design something to help prevent or change this misuse. Create studies, drawings, tests, and prototypes for early scheduled feedback. Your design will likely be speculative, so you will need to consider ways to gain feedback on it without fully building it out, such as “Wizard of Oz.” Create a final version of the design based on feedback. Document your design in a way that builds a narrative around it. Recommended: staged or manipulated photograph, short video, or GIF. Your final outcome should be finished and presentation ready. For group work, be prepared to explain how you divided the labor. 


#### Showing Your Progress

Create a short 4 minute presentation on your progress to date. Do not show every step of your process. Start with the technology that you choose, show us the turning points and revelations that you had throughout the process. Turning points should be evident through your research and/or prototype. Show nice clear images of your prototype, from multiple angles. You can even include a super short video of it in action, or/and even the feedback from users.

Practice your presentation to ensure that it fits within the time constraints. Make sure, when you practice to play/run all of your media to ensure you do not exceed your time limit. Also detail the interesting points or methods used in your research. 

These presentations will take place during class on March 9th & 11th.


### Tips for your presentation (seriously....read and review these. It makes ALL the difference....)


• PRACTICE aloud. Yes, talk it out, not just rehearse it in your head.


• PRACTICE aloud, including your media play time. It's surprising how much time it eats up.

• The more we PRACTICE, the more comfortable with what we are saying as well as knowing what we are going to say next. PRACTICE
