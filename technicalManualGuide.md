### Technical Manual + Guide

#### Create a technical manual/guide for the care and use of your object. This manual can be for a future iteration of your object. It does not have to be for the current iteration. In fact, this manual should reflect the development of your object, given the development of your story and world.


#### What is your object used for? Use the following examples below as a guide and as examples to then create your manual/guide.

#### This is to be a *high-fidelity guide*. Embed this document into a website post under your Future project.
